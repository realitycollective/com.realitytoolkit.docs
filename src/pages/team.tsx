                <Text>The Reality Toolkit was originally based on the MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit), created by Microsoft as a successor to the popular HoloToolkit. While the Reality Toolkit took its own path eversince and does things differently in many areas, we'd like to recognize a few people who have left their signature on its journey:</Text>
