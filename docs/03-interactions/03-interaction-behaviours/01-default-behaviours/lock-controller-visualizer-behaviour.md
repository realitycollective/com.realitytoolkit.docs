# LockControllerVisualizerBehaviour

Use this interaction behaviour to lock your controller visualizer to the interactable while interacting.
This is useful e.g. when implementing levers, door knobs and such, where you want the controller visualizer to stick
with the object instead of using the controller sensors / hand tracking data to determine its position in space.
