# Configure the service

Now that the service is registered, let's take a look at configuration options.

## Startup Behaviour

There is three settings related to locomotion startup behaviour in total.

### Locomotion Startup Behaviour

This setting defines whether locomotion is enabled or disabled on application launch on a global level. Settings this setting to `Manual Start` will also disable free movement and teleportation on app launch, regardless of their individiual startup behaviour.

#### Runtime API

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().LocomotionEnabled = false;
```

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().LocomotionEnabled = true;
```

### Movement Startup Behaviour

This settings defines whether free movement will be available immediately after the application has launched.

#### Runtime API

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().MovementEnabled = false;
```

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().MovementEnabled = true;
```

### Teleport Startup Behaviour

This settings defines whether teleportation will be available immediately after the application has launched.

#### Runtime API

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().TeleportationEnabled = false;
```

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().TeleportationEnabled = true;
```

## Teleport Cooldown

This defaults to `0`, meaning that your player can teleport right after completing a teleportation. Settings this value to e.g. `1`, will induce a one second cooldown phase after a teleport. Your player will only be able to teleport again, once the cooldown phase has ended.

```csharp
ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().TeleportCooldownDuration = 1f;
```

```csharp
var isCoolingDown = ServiceManager.Instance.GetService<ILocomotionService>().IsTeleportCoolingDown;
```

## Locomotion Service Modules

The locomotion service is powered a collection of service modules. Each responsible for a specific feature of the overall service. Check the individual module configuraton profiles for advanced configuration options.
