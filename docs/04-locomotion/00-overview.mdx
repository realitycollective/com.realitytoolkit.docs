# Overview

The Reality Toolkit comes with a ready to use locomotion service. The locomotion module enables your player to move freely or use teleportation to reach their destination within virtual environments. Should you ever feel the need to customize locomotion, the system is designed to be extendable as well.

For a quick overview on what the locomotion service can do for your app or game, check out the locomotion trailer below.
