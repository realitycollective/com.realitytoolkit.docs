# Set Up The Locomotion Service

## Installation

Before we can get started using locomotion, we have to install the `RealityToolkit.Locomotion` package first.

Make sure to always use the same source for all toolkit modules. Avoid using different installation sources within the same project. We provide the following ways to install Reality Toolkit modules:

### Method 1: Using Package Manager for git users

1. Open the Package Manager using the Window menu -> Package Manager

2. Inside the Package Manager, click on the "+" button on the top left and select "Add package from git URL..."

3. Input the following URL: https://github.com/realitycollective/com.realitytoolkit.locomotion.git and click "Add".

### Method 2: OpenUPM

```text
    openupm add com.realitytoolkit.locomotion
```

### Method 3: Unity Asset Store

This option will be available soon.

## Register The Locomotion Service

To register the locomotion service find the `GlobalServiceManager` game object in your scene and select it. You'll see a list of services registered with the service framework here. It should be looking something along side this:

<CenteredImage src={globalServiceManagerImage} alt="The global service manager inspector is where we register toolkit services." />

Select the little "+" at the bottom of the service list to create a new entry. From the service type dropdown select the `LocomotionService`. This will pre-fill the service name, which you can leave as it is or change as you like. Select the profile picker
and assign the default locomotion service profile that comes with the package. It is configured to fit most scenarios out of the box. Last but not least, set the runtime platform to `Everything`, unless you want the service to only run on specific platforms. When you are done, your entry should look like this:

<CenteredImage src={locomotionServiceRegisteredImage} alt="The locomotion service entry in the registered services profile." />

Congratulations! The locomotion service is now registered and ready to run. Let's move on and learn about the different kinds of locomotion available to us.
