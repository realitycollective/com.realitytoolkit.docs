# Teleportation Anchor

A teleport anchor is essentially a pre-defined pose in the virtual world your users can teleport to. Instead of letting your users teleport to wherever they want, you may choose
to only allow teleporting to anchors. For this the toolkit comes with a default `TeleportAnchor` component.

Attach it to a GameObject to make that object a teleport anchor. The component comes with events you can hook up to either programmatically or in the inspector.
